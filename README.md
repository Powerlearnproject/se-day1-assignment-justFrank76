#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that focuses on designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications in a systematic and disciplined manner.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry in the following ways:
a) Through rigorous testing and structured design, software engineering ensures high quality software.
b) Software engineering principles allow businesses to scale their applications effectively, handling increased user demand and data without major performance issues.
c) Structured development practices prevent costly mistakes, rework, and delays, saving businesses time and resources.
d) Secure coding practices help improve security and compliance.
e) Software engineering drives innovation in cutting edge technologies which enables technological advancements.


3. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

a) The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
This was a response to the "software crisis," where software projects faced significant delays, cost overruns, and failures due to the lack of structured development processes.
The conference emphasized the need for engineering principles in software development, leading to the creation of formal methodologies and practices.

b) The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)
Edsger W. Dijkstra advocated for structured programming to improve code readability and maintainability.
This approach replaced the chaotic use of "goto" statements with control structures like loops and conditionals, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
Programming languages such as Pascal, C, and Ada were developed to support structured programming.

c) The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001-Present)
In response to the limitations of traditional Waterfall development, the Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001.
Agile emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability over rigid planning and documentation.
Frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps have since revolutionized software development, enabling faster releases and continuous improvements.


5. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Idea generation - Defines project goals, feasibility, scope, and resource allocation. Helps Identify risks and creates a project roadmap.
2. Requirements Analysis - Gathers and documents user needs and system requirements. It ensures clarity between stakeholders and developers.
3. Product design - Creates system architecture, UI/UX design, and database structures. Helps define how the software will function and interact with components.
4. Product development - Developers write code based on design specifications and they also follow programming best practices and version control.
5. Integration and testing - Identifies and fixes bugs through unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing. Ensures software meets quality and functional expectations.
6. Deployment - Releases the software for end-users in a live environment.
7. Maintenance - Provides bug fixes, updates, and performance improvements. This helps adapt software to new requirements or technologies.


7. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The following are the differences between Waterfall and Agile methodologies in software development:
1. In terms of approach, Waterfall methodology has a linear, sequential approach to where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next while Agile methodology has a  iterative, flexible approach that focuses on continuous improvement, collaboration, and customer feedback.
2. In terms of process, Waterfall methodology follows a fixed structure, including requirement gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance while Agile methodology follows continuous cycles of planning, coding, testing, and feedback.
3. In terms of flexibility, Waterfall methodology is rigid and changes are difficult to implement while Agile methodology is highly adaptable to changing requirements.
4. In terms of testing, testing in Waterfall methodology is done at the end after development while for Agile methodology it is contunous in each iteration.
5. In terms of documentation, Waterfall methodology is extensive and required before development starts while for Agile methodology documentation is minimal with focus on working software

Waterfall methodology software development can be used in:
a) Large, well-defined projects where requirements are stable and unlikely to change.
b) Regulatory or compliance-driven industries (e.g., banking, healthcare) that require strict documentation.
c) Hardware-dependent projects, such as embedded systems where changes are costly.

Agile methodology software development can be used in:
a) Dynamic, fast-changing environments where requirements evolve frequently.
b) Customer-driven applications where feedback and usability are crucial (e.g., mobile apps, SaaS products).
c) Startups and innovation projects requiring quick iterations and rapid market testing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing- Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to verify that they work correctly. Usually automated using testing frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), Jest (JavaScript).
Importance:
a) Ensures that each function, method, or module works as expected.
b) Helps in catching bugs early, reducing debugging time later.
c) Facilitates refactoring and code changes by ensuring functionality remains intact.

2. Integration Testing- Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between multiple units, modules, or components to ensure they work together as intended. Can be conducted using API testing tools like Postman, SoapUI, or frameworks like TestNG and Mocha.
Importance:
a) Detects issues in communication between components, such as incorrect data transfer or API failures.
b) Identifies compatibility issues when integrating third-party services, databases, or microservices.
c) Reduces the risk of system failures caused by module integration problems.

3. System Testing- System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets functional and non-functional requirements. Performed in a staging environment similar to production.
Importance:
a) Ensures the entire application works as a complete system.
b) Tests the application’s behavior under real-world conditions.
c) Covers non-functional testing aspects like performance, security, and usability.

4. Acceptance Testing- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. Conducted manually by clients, stakeholders, or beta testers.
Importance:
a) Ensures the software meets client and end-user expectations.
b) Identifies issues from a user perspective, such as UI/UX problems.
c) Serves as the final verification before releasing software to production.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts (input text or queries) to optimize interactions with AI models in a way that improves the accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of AI-generated responses.
Importance of prompt engineering
1. Enhances AI response quality.
2. Improves efficiency & productivity.
3. By adjusting the tone, style, or complexity of a prompt, users can tailor AI-generated responses to fit different audiences and needs.
4. Helps businesses and researchers extract valuable insights by asking data-driven and structured queries.
5. Reduces ambiguity & bias.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   
Vague prompt: "Generate Python code."
Optimized prompt: "Write a Python function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the merge sort algorithm."
The optimized prompt is better than the vague prompt because it provides more detail about the code hence preventing ambiguity of the code generated by the AI.
